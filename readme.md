# introduction

Hello,

In order to apply for my internship at Devatwork, i had to complete a javascript test. In this test i had to write a script that allows 2 values to be summed. Afterwards the result of this sum should be display on screen in either a window or in the console. The should be displayed with a minimal user interface. The goal of the test is simplicity and clear documentation.

## my approach

Since the task was relatively simple, i didnt use any frameworks or libraries. Native javascript is the fastest to load. In my code i wrote some additonal comments to explain further what each line does.

In this test i only had to use each document elements once. For this reason i gave them an ID which i used in my javascript.

I also used the onclick event to execute the function in made in my app.js

At first i wanted to split up each function in a scripts folder but since i only need one function i wrote it directly into the app.js

## test the script

In order to test the script you can either open the index.html in a browser or use the index.html to start a live server.
